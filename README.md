## Random Password Generator
Can't think of a password right now? Maybe we can help! This very basic random password generator will give a password of any length based on randomly generated numbers. Just flash the program onto your micro:bit and press A to see it in action!

This is simplified implementation that was taught to middle-school girls as part of NSA and NSF's GenCyber Cybersecurity Camp at GWU. It intends to educate students on the importance of maintaining a safe and secure online presence.
